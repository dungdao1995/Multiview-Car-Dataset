# Multiview-Car-Dataset
The dataset on this page contains 20 sequences of cars as they rotate by 360 degrees. There is one image approximately every 3-4 degrees. Using the time of capture information from the photos, it is possible to calculate the approximate rotation angle of the car.

The photos have been captured using a Nikon D70 camera on a tripod at the Geneva International Motor Show ’08. The lens used is Nikkor 12-24mm DX f/4. The focal length was kept constant during a single sequence (showing a single car) but varies from sequence to sequence. The focus was set to manual, approx. at the hyperfocal distance.
